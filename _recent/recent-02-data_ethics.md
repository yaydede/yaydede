citation: "<b>Data ethics as an extension of human-subjects research ethics</b>:
Psychological scientists are increasingly interested in harnessing big data and
naturally occurring data, but this new data landscape poses new challenges. I
argue that the Belmont principles of respect for persons, beneficence, and justice
can---and should!---serve as our ethical foundation as we deal with human-derived data
(Paxton, 2020, <i>Big data methods for psychological research: New horizons and
challenges</i>)."
