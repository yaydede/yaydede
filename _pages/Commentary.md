[Research Portal on Machine Learning for Social and Health Policies](https://sites.google.com/view/mlportal/home) 

## About
The portal (MLPortal) provides a hub for researchers who want to make machine learning methods more accessible in social and health science applications for better predictive and causal analyses. We hope to offer a platform for statistical learning by enhancing collaboration between academic circles, policy makers, and private enterprises by disseminating the knowledge that helps others in their works, projects, course offerings, and private applications.
