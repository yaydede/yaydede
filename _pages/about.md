[Curriculum Vitae](http://yaydede.github.io/files/CV6.pdf) 
  
I am a [Sobey](https://www.smu.ca/academics/sobey/sobey-professorships-and-chairs.html) professor in the Department of Economics at [Saint Mary's University](https://smu.ca) in beautiful Halifax.  Although most of my research is in the field of population economics, my current focus is on genomics, unconventional data, chronic disease surveillance systems, and machine learning.  I teach data analytics courses at undergraduate and graduate levels.
  
I am also a co-founder of [Research Portal on Machine Learning for Social and Health Policies](https://yaydede.github.io/MLPortal/) (MLPortal).
  
This Github page summarizes all my work including a draft version of my book, [Toolbox](https://yaydede.github.io/Toolbox/), my recent research, blogs about "anything useful", and teaching.
