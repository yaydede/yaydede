## Data-rich human communication

As a cognitive scientist and data scientist, I take a **data-rich approach** to
understanding **how people collaborate, bond, and fight**. To do that, I
weave together a **variety of data sources from the lab and the real world**
for a converging tapestry of the many ways in which our language, movement,
decisions, and emotions change during social contact. Understanding how
context---including conversational goals, social connections, and physical
spaces---shape our emerging behaviors is a primary goal of my research, embedded
within **rich traditions of dynamical and ecological perspectives** on human
behavior and cognition broadly.

I also **develop methods** to quantify social interaction,
promote **open science** research and education, and
create opportunities for cognitive scientists and psychologists who are
interested in **data science, naturally occurring data, and big data**,
with a special focus on **data ethics**.

## About me

I'm an assistant professor in the
[University of Connecticut](https://uconn.edu/)’s
[Department of Psychological Sciences](https://psych.uconn.edu/), specifically
 within the
[Perception, Action, Cognition division](https://psych.uconn.edu/perception-action-cognition-division/).
I am affiliated with
the [Center for the Ecological Study of Perception and Action](https://cespa.uconn.edu/);
the [Institute for Collaboration on Health, Intervention, and Policy](https://chip.uconn.edu/);
the [Connecticut Institute for the Brain and Cognitive Sciences](https://ibacs.uconn.edu/);
and the [Cognitive Science program](https://cogsci.uconn.edu/).
I am also a faculty mentor in the
[Science of Learning and Art of Communication](https://slac.uconn.edu/)
training program.

I'm proud to lead the [**dyscord lab**](https://dyscord-lab.github.io/).
Together, we explore the
**dy**namics of
**s**ocial
**c**ommunication and
inter-**or**ganism
**d**ependencies.
Our lab includes several graduate students---
[Megan Chiovaro](https://mchiovaro.github.io/),
[Lana Delasanta](https://psych.uconn.edu/person/lana-delasanta/),
[Caitrín ("Cat") Hall](https://psych.uconn.edu/person/caitrin-hall/),
and
Gray Thomas (starting in Fall 2021)---
and a number of bright and hard-working current and former
undergraduate research assistants. You can find out more about our community
and our work [at our lab website](https://dyscord-lab.github.io/). (If you're an
undergraduate student interested in working with the lab, please

Previously, I was a postdoctoral scholar working with
[Tom Griffiths](http://cocosci.princeton.edu/tom/index.php) in the
[Institute of Cognitive and Brain Sciences](http://icbs.berkeley.edu/)
at the [University of California, Berkeley](http://www.berkeley.edu/)
and a [Moore-Sloan Data Science Fellow](http://msdse.org/)
at the [Berkeley Institute for Data Science](http://bids.berkeley.edu/). I
received my Ph.D in
[Cognitive and Information Sciences](http://cogsci.ucmerced.edu/) working with
[Rick Dale](http://co-mind.org/rick/) at the
[University of California, Merced](https://www.ucmerced.edu/).
