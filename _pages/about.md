I am the Sobey Professor of Economics at Saint Mary's University. My research bridges econometrics with modern machine learning and artificial intelligence, focusing on unconventional data sources, public policy, and health analytics. I teach courses in data analytics, machine learning, and AI at both undergraduate and graduate levels.

I also serve as [Faculty in Residence](https://www.smu.ca/sobey/about/dr-yigit-aydede.html) at the Sobey School of Business and as an [Affiliate Scientist (Research)](https://innovationhub.nshealth.ca/partnering-nova-scotia-health-innovation-hub/scientific-affiliate-appointments) at Nova Scotia Health, contributing to interdisciplinary collaborations in health and social sciences.

Beyond academia, I am the co-founder of [Novastorms.ai](https://novastorms.ai), an AI-driven startup providing real estate, neighborhood, and public safety insights in Nova Scotia. Our Agentic AI applications leverage advanced analytics to empower businesses, policymakers, and the public with real-time and historical data.
